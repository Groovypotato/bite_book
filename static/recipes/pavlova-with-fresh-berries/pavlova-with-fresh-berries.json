Made with just a few simple ingredients, this pavlova is topped with a colorful assortment of spring-fresh berries nestled on a bed of whipped cream. The meringue can be baked and cooled up to a day in advance, then topped with the cream and berries just before serving, making it a practical choice for a spring or summer dinner party.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"aa9fa931-2b64-4242-af2b-ce4f71c9fd7d","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Fruit","slug":"fruit"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William Sonoma","slug":"william-sonoma"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/pavlova-with-fresh-berries.html","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T01:59:45.631880Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T01:59:26.658902Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T01:59:45.634791Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"4 egg whites, at room temperature","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"4 egg whites, at room temperature","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"59f20fd1-f19c-4af0-9855-ece19e950244"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 Tbs. cornstarch, sifted","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 Tbs. cornstarch, sifted","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"7ca841ab-3a75-4537-a116-63225b58b321"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 cup (8 oz./250 g) plus 3 Tbs. sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 cup (8 oz./250 g) plus 3 Tbs. sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"d3f283ea-edd2-4f4b-8bd6-f11302f5ef8e"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tsp. vanilla extract","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tsp. vanilla extract","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"ee44e2ee-539b-4257-bbe3-e3e05c68fd07"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 tsp. fresh lemon juice","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 tsp. fresh lemon juice","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"ce8b8ac3-6a3b-4543-a77f-a44e4305d252"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3 cups (12 oz./375 g) assorted fresh berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3 cups (12 oz./375 g) assorted fresh berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"3d6d1a74-e425-4fca-bf28-ed5a5859dcb9"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 1/2 cups (12 fl. oz./375 ml) heavy cream","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 1/2 cups (12 fl. oz./375 ml) heavy cream","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"732ce491-1ab7-424c-b257-f295f9009432"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"e23435c1-fd6e-4013-9ad8-6f6987350158","title":"","summary":"","text":"Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 250°F (120°C).
