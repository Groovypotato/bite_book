Both this recipe and Rose Levy Beranbaum's Chocolate Oblivion Truffle Torte are known and loved as flourless chocolate cakes and use the same basic three ingredients (eggs, chocolate, and butter), with wildly different appearances and textures. This one was a signature dessert of the late, beloved writer and cooking instructor Richard Sax. For the same amount of eggs as Beranbaum’s, he calls for half the chocolate and butter, and—instead of heating and whipping six whole eggs until billowy—he has you whip four of the whites with sugar to make a fluffy meringue, then gently fold them into the rest. Far from a dense and creamy torte, these three changes produce a poufy soufflé of a cake that intentionally caves in the center, leaving a craggy, wafer-like rim behind and a moussey hollow that you fill up with cold whipped cream. The effect is dramatic and bold, giving you, as Sax famously said, “intensity, then relief, in each bite.” Adapted very slightly from Genius Desserts (Ten Speed Press, 2018).","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"775dc6ea-b9b8-4404-a592-b28c3f5e528a","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"159ef61d-8647-4722-8274-7b9baa9da436","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Chocolate","slug":"chocolate"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://food52.com/recipes/78350-richard-sax-s-chocolate-cloud-cake?utm_source=Instagram&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_campaign=Social","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T02:52:55.166112Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T02:52:39.978378Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T02:52:55.169165Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"8 ounce (225g) best-quality bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"8 ounce (225g) best-quality bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"1411b128-fd50-4bed-8b1f-a2c6709bb45d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 cup (110g) unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into 1-tablespoon pieces","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 cup (110g) unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into 1-tablespoon pieces","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"592d59a1-86ca-4057-b897-3640a2d96502"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 large eggs","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"6 large eggs","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"62ff660d-e443-425d-9410-2b8dc6b21698"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 cup (200g) sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 cup (200g) sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"941cf4ad-d7da-487f-a9d6-44c243c99967"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoon cognac or Grand Marnier (optional)","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoon cognac or Grand Marnier (optional)","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"f44f128d-9552-4d90-a097-b9584876d07c"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Finely grated zest of 1 orange (about 1 tablespoon; optional)","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Finely grated zest of 1 orange (about 1 tablespoon; optional)","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"78504a1f-5efb-42b3-b864-17f18a01446d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 1/2 cup (355g) heavy cream, very cold","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 1/2 cup (355g) heavy cream, very cold","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"38a74c1e-430f-44c7-99e8-077dc91a85b1"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"b572884e-28ec-4cef-a910-705834979bee"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"5d345fb2-4e4e-4518-8cfe-a5d6b5cfa2a6"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Unsweetened cocoa powder and/or bittersweet chocolate shavings, for topping","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Unsweetened cocoa powder and/or bittersweet chocolate shavings, for topping","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"8d55067d-116a-4840-917c-8806684cd26f"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"ca59dae5-32d2-492d-9e77-334f0cd22f5e","title":"","summary":"","text":"To make the cake, heat the oven to 350°F (175°C), with a rack in the center.
