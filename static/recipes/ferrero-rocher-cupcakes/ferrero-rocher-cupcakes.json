The cupcakes have a rich chocolate flavour and always turn out super fluffy. The chocolate is baked right into the cupcake which makes stuffing them so much easier.This recipe makes 16 Ferrero Rocher cupcakes instead of 12 because of the extra batter the chocolates end up displacing. If you only have 1 cupcake tin, just reserve the leftover batter and bake the last 4 cupcakes after the first batch is ready.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"159ef61d-8647-4722-8274-7b9baa9da436","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"b43f69c5-967f-4797-b840-ec007487c2e2","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cupcakes","slug":"cupcakes"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://flouringkitchen.com/ferrero-rocher-cupcakes/","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T20:24:33.581277Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T20:22:56.834112Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T20:24:33.584900Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"½

Bake for 7-10 minutes, mixing them halfway. They are ready when the skin starts to separate and they are a very light golden color underneath. Let them cool and wrap the hazelnuts in a kitchen towel. Rub them well so that the skins come off and they are ready to use!"}],"extras":{},"comments":[]}
