To quickly and evenly distribute the cereal in the sticky melted marshmallows, it helps to use two utensils and stir the blend like youâ€™re frying rice. Pressing the mixture into a 9-inch square baking pan turns out perfect squares, but the size and shape of your vessel is up to you. Another option is to spread out the mixture on a greased sheet pan into airy clusters. If you want to feel like a kid (or are one), you can put those clusters into a bowl and pour over milk to enjoy as cereal.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"0d02fe42-8578-4fdf-870e-c08faf2d30d5","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Desserts","slug":"desserts"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024985-black-sesame-rice-krispies-treats?utm_campaign=likeshopme&utm_content=ig-nytcooking&utm_medium=instagram&utm_source=dash+hudson","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T03:49:00.496060Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T03:48:05.399676Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T03:49:00.498924Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for greasing","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for greasing","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"d1f3fb95-5b53-4d47-909f-4de8af4819b2"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"a8bc9bbc-0251-480e-aef8-61989973ed0f"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/4 cup/38 grams black sesame seeds (see Tip)","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/4 cup/38 grams black sesame seeds (see Tip)","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"12dbbac6-8439-4464-a7d1-cefa8bd95453"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 (12-ounce/340-gram) bag marshmallows","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 (12-ounce/340-gram) bag marshmallows","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"e4ce8e42-682b-4fa9-8202-9f9e84b17a8b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 1 teaspoon flaky kosher salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 1 teaspoon flaky kosher salt","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"7612d3e6-f6a4-43f7-babd-03822e9ed3ca"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 cups/160 grams Rice Krispies cereal","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"6 cups/160 grams Rice Krispies cereal","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"e7b17646-e78a-4e7a-99ff-ed12d411df47"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"2407c215-1c5d-4463-a828-e8da6c82c558","title":"","summary":"","text":"Grease a 9-inch square baking pan with sesame oil.","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"507c30ea-beda-45f2-958f-415ad56f2883","title":"","summary":"","text":"In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the milk solids at the bottom of the pan start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
