This Ombre Mocha Bundt Cake has a secret ingredient: Dalgona Coffee! We use whipped coffee to make our cake layers extra colorful and flavorful. Vanilla, coffee, and mocha cake layers come together to make the tastiest ombre you have ever seen and then we make it even more delicious by pouring a vanilla glaze over the whole cake and topping with chocolate shavings and chocolate covered espresso beans. The Nordic Ware Brilliance Bundt Pan is perfect for this recipe. The crisp detail on the cake is thanks to the heavy duty cast aluminum pan! To prepare the Bundt pan, you can use shortening or butter to coat the pan, then add some flour and tap around the pan until it is completely covered, tapping out any excess. You can also use an oil and flour based nonstick baking spray, but be sure to avoid cooking spray. When you are layering in the batters, we found it helped a LOT to use an ice cream scoop to layer in the batter and make sure each layer is even so you don’t fill the pan more than ¾ of the way. As you smooth each layer, it helps to use a spoon to press each layer of batter up against the sides of the pan so you get distinct layers. Finally, to ensure a dense, delicious cake, tap the pan a couple times to pop any air bubbles. This cake is really rich and thick, making it perfect to pair with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate. This cake is a fun and fancy addition to any breakfast bar or brunch! This month we are celebrating National Bundt Cake Day coming up on November 15th, 2020 with our friends at Nordic Ware. Nordic Ware is a family-owned company that has been producing high quality cooking & baking kitchenware products since 1946 in Minneapolis! Looking for more Bundt Cake inspiration?
