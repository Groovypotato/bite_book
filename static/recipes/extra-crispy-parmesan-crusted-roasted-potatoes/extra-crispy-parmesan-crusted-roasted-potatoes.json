The initial boil with aromatics adds herbal flavor to the potatoes, without the potential of burned herbs in the final roast, while baking soda in the water helps soften the surface of the potato, releasing starch. This starch combines with Parmesan and melted butter to form a flavorful slurry that crisps up and coats each potato chunk in a cheesy shell.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"5abf51be-465b-46a1-b4c2-b5f5f733bf7c","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Kenji","slug":"kenji"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020633-extra-crispy-parmesan-crusted-roasted-potatoes","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T20:22:39.858155Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T20:22:20.945896Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T20:22:39.861463Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"1e03b210-cd40-466c-874f-004f460af0bc"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 teaspoon baking soda","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 teaspoon baking soda","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"2420063a-999d-4909-98c5-664d5aaeb132"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons kosher salt, or 1 tablespoon table salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons kosher salt, or 1 tablespoon table salt","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"12447a13-6931-4cbf-b602-b1d8e9de8de8"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"4 dried bay leaves, preferably Turkish","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"4 dried bay leaves, preferably Turkish","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"9494d26a-5cbe-4eea-a6b8-4830eb26f6b5"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"f210c477-5c92-457e-b7cb-5ab62a030107"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 whole garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"6 whole garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"ece9f08f-f431-4a8b-bfd8-3bc3bdf92f4d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3 to 4 thyme or rosemary sprigs, or a mix","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3 to 4 thyme or rosemary sprigs, or a mix","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"35e22842-c6bf-4c50-a009-39e1d504d209"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"2bedbe00-4998-4d7c-8e6d-71dd34db6067"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 ounces finely grated Parmesan (about 1 cup)","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 ounces finely grated Parmesan (about 1 cup)","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"c52606ee-a846-46b5-bf6d-3f791a1bd86e"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"28e6fec3-c9b7-47bd-8055-5e9bf96c4eac"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"d9fe323f-8213-4f3a-9e88-33ff6562a66e","title":"","summary":"","text":"Adjust oven rack to center position and heat to 425 degrees, or 400 degrees if using convection.
