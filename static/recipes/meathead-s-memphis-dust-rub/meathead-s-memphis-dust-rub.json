It is carefully formulated for flavor, color, and to form the proper crust when cooked at low temps. Try it on chicken, fish, and vegetables too. The amount here is enough for about 24 slabs of ribs when using 2 tablespoons per slab. Use enough to cover the meat surface but still let some meat show through. Store the extra rub in a zipper bag or a glass jar with a tight lid.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"a2db553a-b1d2-43b5-8c09-620c1317c9a4","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Spice","slug":"spice"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/spice-rubs-and-pastes/meatheads-memphis-dust-rub-recipe/","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T01:08:32.094120Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T01:08:15.867104Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T01:08:32.097588Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"¾ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"¾ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"ac0d25ef-9e9a-49c9-9c8f-f4472247d7dc"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"¾ cup white sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"¾ cup white sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"4dbed0a3-9587-42fe-b6c4-7edd4ef260b0"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"½ cup American paprika","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"½ cup American paprika","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"b9856138-3dd6-4ce6-9fa2-74e9106f260f"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"¼ cup garlic powder","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"¼ cup garlic powder","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"225b1c2c-c33a-4c36-90d8-01812b22972b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons ground black pepper","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons ground black pepper","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"4dd3198e-ada5-439c-9f62-52d08b1991da"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons ground ginger powder","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons ground ginger powder","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"2a2463c4-9ffe-4800-b374-a3e21475bc9b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons onion powder","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons onion powder","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"039c1020-3b9f-447f-b255-e5f80f21bd5c"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 tablespoon rosemary","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 tablespoon rosemary","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"ad07dabe-07c8-4dd8-9a92-fdbb3e4ed08c"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"3ae48cbc-e1ed-4949-909d-54de41a30f67","title":"","summary":"","text":"Mix.

Since our rub recipes contain no salt (we explain why in the headnote above), we recommend you sprinkle on 1/2 teaspoon of Morton Coarse Kosher Salt per pound (453.6 g) of meat up to 12 hours in advance. For most meats, dampen the surface of the meat with water and sprinkle enough Meathead's Memphis Dust on to coat, but not so much you can't see the meat below. Apply the rub thick enough to make a crunchy crust. Keep your powder dry as the old expression goes. To prevent cross-contamination, one hand sprinkles on the rub and the other hand does the rubbing. Don't put the hand that is rubbing into the powder or use it to hold the bottle.","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"eb85c468-8feb-460f-a2d0-a9b5789cab67","title":"","summary":"","text":"For A Whole Hog.
