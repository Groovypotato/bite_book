The chocolate is cut into chunks to prevent chip congregation, and once the dough is formed into a cylindrical log, the whole thing gets rolled in Demerara sugar for the crispiest-ever edges. Less chocolate chip cookie, more brown sugar shortbread with chocolate chunks—they just might be the cookie you’ve been looking for.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"159ef61d-8647-4722-8274-7b9baa9da436","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"ed5a7efc-9ac8-4a73-be55-00d57c016ef9","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cookies","slug":"cookies"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.alisoneroman.com/recipes/salted-butter-chocolate-chunk-shortbread","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T14:18:31.647969Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T14:16:07.574930Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T14:18:31.652352Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2¼ sticks) cold salted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2¼ sticks) cold salted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"2d00e69c-bb16-4462-ad6b-7b0aeb0eecd7"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"½ cup granulated sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"½ cup granulated sugar","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"8c816474-2825-4c35-94b2-89463a02ad6b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"a8362151-31b5-4dc6-ad4d-b41f545397cc"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 teaspoon vanilla extract","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 teaspoon vanilla extract","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"bf7310ad-dd49-4d27-a409-1eba722190a1"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2¼ cups all-purpose flour","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2¼ cups all-purpose flour","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"9fc26b6b-6f68-4b36-a212-e93299700179"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (but not too fine, you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (but not too fine, you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"35b856f8-e4fe-422c-b566-6a3f608d2b4d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 large egg, beaten to blend","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 large egg, beaten to blend","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"4d8d375c-75f8-441f-bb18-2258ee3d5874"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Demerara sugar (for rolling)","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Demerara sugar (for rolling)","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"7e68c3d6-9b0e-488d-8760-abfe97cf3d7d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Flaky sea salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Flaky sea salt","title":"","original_text":null,"reference_id":"398e0627-d4db-4f3a-8093-71bde9831a53"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"104e84a0-2c2b-4bb9-a44d-00ee6e89b3c7","title":"","summary":"","text":"Line a rimmed baking sheet (two, if you’ve got ’em) with parchment paper.","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"492afce5-f624-4e33-9f22-d8c5af0a402d","title":"","summary":"","text":"Using an electric mixer and a medium bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, both sugars, and vanilla on medium-high till it’s super light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes.

You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but I find using plastic wrap easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form two logs 2 to 2¼ inches in diameter.
