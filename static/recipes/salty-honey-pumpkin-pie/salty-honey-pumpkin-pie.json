Some honeys will crystalize while in the oven and others will not. If your pie has a layer of foam, no worries, it’s easy to remove to reveal a glassy pie beneath: While the pie is still warm, take a piece of plastic wrap that is larger than the circumference of the pie and lay it on top of the pie, very very gently pressing to encourage the plastic to adhere to the top of the pie. Holding the plastic with two hands, peel it off of the pie. The foamy layer should come off with it. If you miss a few spots, you can always repeat this process again.
