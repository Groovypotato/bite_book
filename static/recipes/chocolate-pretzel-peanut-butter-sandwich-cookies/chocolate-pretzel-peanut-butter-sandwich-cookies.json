If using natural peanut butter, made without the additives that prevent the oil from separating, stir in the oil layer thoroughly before measuring. Cashew or almond butter is a good choice for anyone with a peanut allergy. To crush the pretzels, put them in a small food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Or, place the pretzels in a zippered plastic bag, seal it, and gently hit it with a rolling pin to break them up.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"159ef61d-8647-4722-8274-7b9baa9da436","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"ed5a7efc-9ac8-4a73-be55-00d57c016ef9","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cookies","slug":"cookies"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William Sonoma","slug":"william-sonoma"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/chocolate-pretzel-peanut-butter-sandwich-cookies.html","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T18:06:00.144820Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T18:05:00.696422Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T18:06:00.148217Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 cups (10 oz./315 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 cups (10 oz./315 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting","title":"For the cookies:","original_text":null,"reference_id":"ca73bfab-00b9-4343-b021-86d884d47f78"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 tsp. kosher salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 tsp. kosher salt","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"20bdd8ff-42e7-49eb-8e22-513664f0b2a8"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 cup (8 oz./250 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 cup (8 oz./250 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"819fd83e-1503-4c88-8d06-91bde6a3b00b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 cup (4 oz./125 g) sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 cup (4 oz./125 g) sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"8a195178-7f4c-4b25-9e1c-7b71e77a4deb"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tsp. vanilla extract","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tsp. vanilla extract","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"6df6d561-b923-4e13-966b-d78f449cef9c"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 cup (4 oz./125 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 cup (4 oz./125 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature","title":"For the filling:","original_text":null,"reference_id":"e1d9aab1-bc65-42af-a104-bd757cba0542"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 cup (10 oz./315 g) creamy peanut butter","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 cup (10 oz./315 g) creamy peanut butter","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"81b16d8f-a0b7-477f-9264-91cff376eeba"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 1/2 cups (6 oz./185 g) confectioners’ sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 1/2 cups (6 oz./185 g) confectioners’ sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"4abb313f-a407-44ac-addc-81f77c8c4dc7"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Pinch of kosher salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Pinch of kosher salt","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"702d68ce-f12f-4357-b7d6-84e78bf95dd0"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 Tbs.
