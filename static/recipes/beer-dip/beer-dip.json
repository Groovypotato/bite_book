Editor's Tip: If your cream cheese is still cold from the fridge, it might take a little elbow grease to get the texture right. You can quickly soften cream cheese by microwaving the block for 20 seconds in five-second intervals. Or, if you have a little time, letting the cream cheese sit at room temperature for 35 to 45 minutes should do the trick.","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"9806d6a3-34e7-4e17-98e2-e134b53eb71c","title":"","summary":"","text":"Add the cheese","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"b52208cf-55e9-49b4-b619-b395b182503b","title":"","summary":"","text":"Stir in the cheddar until evenly combined.
