She says that fall is her favorite season. Jocelyn loves the changing leaves, brisk mornings, pies for the holiday season (or just because) and, yes, apple picking, a tradition she adopted from her in-laws. Every year at the onset of autumn, they visit places like the County Line Orchard in Indiana. From music in the barnyard to the kids’ petting zoo her daughter Harmony adored, they all fell in love with the place. Each time, she leaves with plenty of apple cider, apple cinnamon donuts and, duh, apples. But instead of spending all day making pie, she opted for a moist, spiced snacking cake. You’ll have the rest of the season to bake pies, Jocelyn says, so take it easy and have a slice of this cake with your morning coffee—or whenever you need a pick-me-up.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"adef1176-fddc-49bd-b6e4-8441580a26ca","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Alcohol","slug":"alcohol"},{"id":"83904ad5-c433-4760-bd42-1838761b3232","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Apple","slug":"apple"},{"id":"775dc6ea-b9b8-4404-a592-b28c3f5e528a","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William
