Rich and dark with soft carbonation, stouts can range from sweet to dry with big roasty-toasty notes. Expect notes of chocolate, sweet caramel or bitter coffee—all of which work beautifully with the cocoa powder and malted milk in our layer cake. If needed, you can use 9-inch (23-cm) cake pans, trimming a few minutes from the bake time.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"7588a9d7-2086-49f3-a3a0-4581caaa894b","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Beer","slug":"beer"},{"id":"775dc6ea-b9b8-4404-a592-b28c3f5e528a","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"159ef61d-8647-4722-8274-7b9baa9da436","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"f550851a-2a35-4c68-a892-bd5c4af50e35","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Malt","slug":"malt"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William Sonoma","slug":"william-sonoma"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/cocoa-stout-cake-with-malted-buttercream.html","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T18:26:47.120064Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T18:25:16.271117Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T18:26:47.125079Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 1/2 cups (12 fl. oz./375 ml) stout or porter beer","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 1/2 cups (12 fl. oz./375 ml) stout or porter beer","title":"For the cake:","original_text":null,"reference_id":"8abba645-2ab8-4d59-8d6f-eeefafba209a"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"12 Tbs.
