The leeks are sliced two different ways before cooking: two are cut into rounds, while one is halved lengthwise. Ready-to-use phyllo dough streamlines prep (there’s no need to prepare a tart dough) and gives your creation a fanciful finish. You will need only eight of the phyllo dough sheets from the package; save the rest for another use.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"46b6df40-9d40-40d9-99d6-4e6cb8f9895c","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William Sonoma","slug":"william-sonoma"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.williams-sonoma.com/m/recipe/phyllo-quiche-with-leeks-and-parmesan.html?crl8_id=1f1677b0-f9b9-4012-8dc9-e2d49c336b5e&cm_cat=Like2Buy&utm_source=like2buy.curalate.com&cm_ite=phylloquiche&cm_ven=socialmedia&cm_pla=recipe","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T02:13:12.857174Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T02:12:58.158483Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T02:13:12.860185Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 package (1 lb./500 g) phyllo dough sheets, each 14 by 18 inches (35 by 45 cm), thawed","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 package (1 lb./500 g) phyllo dough sheets, each 14 by 18 inches (35 by 45 cm), thawed","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"9306d170-7b12-4c53-b24e-edff5a0d779c"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3 leeks, trimmed, white and light green portions","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3 leeks, trimmed, white and light green portions","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"d87891fb-5026-4e0c-97bd-df1d0fafefb0"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"4 Tbs.
