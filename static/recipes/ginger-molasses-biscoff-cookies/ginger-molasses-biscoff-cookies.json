And then came Biscoff cookie butter, a rich, warmly spiced spread that captures the essence of the well-loved cookie in a different form. In this recipe, we celebrate both. The soft and chewy cookies (made with whole wheat flour!) are lightly spiced with ginger and cinnamon in the spirit of the original Biscoff cookies. They’re used to sandwich a gooey, fudgy filling of sweetened cookie butter. Add some shine and welcome crunch with coarse sparkling sugar, or swap in your garnish of choice. (Festive sprinkles are welcome!)","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"ed5a7efc-9ac8-4a73-be55-00d57c016ef9","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cookies","slug":"cookies"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/ginger-molasses-biscoff-cookies-recipe?trk_msg=5F5EL56VIO44R26QRGTJOU7EU4&trk_contact=GFMPMHKGGQUP5E5JPSEC0ALIT0&trk_sid=PKI9L6E95IJLDTSE7BJE7TI0TS&trk_link=DOOQKBEQ6H4KDC0VD8AGM4U0A0&utm_source=ltk_master&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.kingarthurbaking.com%2frecipes%2fginger-molasses-biscoff-cookies-recipe&utm_campaign=ec-221201&utm_content=botw-gingermolasses-biscoff","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T21:48:23.736862Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T21:45:18.751344Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T21:48:23.740736Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/4 cup (57g) water","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/4 cup (57g) water","title":"Biscoff Cookie Filling","original_text":null,"reference_id":"9d258b55-6115-4d86-9a47-ade94dee95ee"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 cup (85g) white baking chips or morsels","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 cup (85g) white baking chips or morsels","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"2dd9e834-c832-479d-95c3-7044ff3ebc31"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3/4 cup (216g) Biscoff Cookie Butter Spread, crunchy or smooth","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3/4 cup (216g) Biscoff Cookie Butter Spread, crunchy or smooth","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"c1d1a48c-7a23-4d55-8ef0-a88abe6f4763"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 cups (226g) King Arthur Golden Wheat Flour","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 cups (226g) King Arthur Golden Wheat Flour","title":"Cookies","original_text":null,"reference_id":"56556acc-8334-46f0-9489-de78ba9aadec"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 teaspoon baking soda","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 teaspoon baking soda","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"a81376f5-d4db-4b7f-95f2-b113c33f7e0b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2/3 cup (142g) dark brown sugar, packed","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2/3 cup (142g) dark brown sugar, packed","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"d79d369a-016e-488f-863a-7b8c6b1555d8"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"4147b6ee-9450-4d4d-a250-85ec5b584026"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/2 teaspoon table salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/2 teaspoon table salt","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"3a4580b7-6042-457a-8cbd-2a8be008b533"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/4 teaspoons ginger","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/4 teaspoons ginger","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"4e4615c2-457a-4934-b17b-a646de890ccb"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/4 teaspoon cinnamon","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/4 teaspoon cinnamon","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"7425699f-2e07-46d9-a254-49f1e6a9a077"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 large egg","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 large egg","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"b4bfb84b-c0f0-49cc-a9eb-3ce9c7ccafcc"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1/4 cup (85g) molasses","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1/4 cup (85g) molasses","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"3a07005c-c13b-4345-9f84-37a440526c7c"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Swedish pearl sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Swedish pearl sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"cae79384-708b-4986-bcc3-f835e7c0da40"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"coarse sparkling sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"coarse sparkling sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"5d8635b4-16ed-4466-8a53-a10f5675a870"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"sprinkles","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"sprinkles","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"33c81019-6e84-4e50-8a68-760b0f113cac"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"5f12d34d-0ae1-4629-b5cb-bac78e7521e3","title":"","summary":"","text":"To make the Biscoff cookie filling: Place all the ingredients in a medium heat-proof bowl.
