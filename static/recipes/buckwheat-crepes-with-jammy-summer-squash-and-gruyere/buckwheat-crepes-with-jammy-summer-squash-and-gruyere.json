Tilt the pan in all directions to distribute the batter around the skillet and up the edges by about 1”. Really get in there and tilt!! Cook until the edges curl and the underside is golden brown, 2 to 2 ½ minutes. Using a spatula, carefully but swiftly lift and flip the crepe. Continue cooking until lightly golden, about 2 minutes more. Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining batter, replenishing butter between batches.
