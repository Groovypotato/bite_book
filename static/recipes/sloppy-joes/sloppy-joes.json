We created a homemade sauce that is tangy and flavorful but also quick and easy. We used both ketchup and canned tomato sauce for lots of tomato-y zip and just a touch of brown sugar for a bit of sweetness and slight caramel finish. Green bell pepper is a key addition; it really enhances the other ingredients, elevating the flavor profile into the realm of a true sloppy joe.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"5233bdfa-2791-4dcf-ba95-cf14e0af41ed","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Main","slug":"main"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/the-best-sloppy-joes-7263253.amp","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T15:13:12.651583Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T15:12:51.411059Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T15:13:12.654778Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons unsalted butter","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons unsalted butter","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"6e84d55f-b4e2-4f24-8305-9c42f3b611fa"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 medium onion, diced","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 medium onion, diced","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"a6e6fa48-fe61-430b-a154-4b68f2a7e38f"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 green bell pepper, diced","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 green bell pepper, diced","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"8a819320-2cf7-48e1-af18-9e9b3223e3ce"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 clove garlic, minced","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 clove garlic, minced","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"7dbf3ab8-3b4e-4f36-aa0b-c2ce6640ab8e"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 pound lean ground beef","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 pound lean ground beef","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"0f9526fc-0b06-4749-94d4-dd9ed64ddf8e"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"12 ounces (1 1/3 cup) tomato sauce","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"12 ounces (1 1/3 cup) tomato sauce","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"0357e9b7-39fd-4e8e-9f4b-0dc740f8faf7"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"3/4 cup ketchup","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"3/4 cup ketchup","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"e3dbff64-0df6-4d23-a41e-698dcc84856b"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons brown sugar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons brown sugar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"11324b40-25ab-4f90-9c9f-b43120fb6426"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"e48517c6-af15-4289-953c-4d17c6629e66"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 tablespoon yellow mustard","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 tablespoon yellow mustard","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"6e9c6255-3db3-4438-84a5-c7a8e1140082"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 tablespoon red wine vinegar","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 tablespoon red wine vinegar","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"46c72b75-82fa-4613-8f2c-8f42ecf89d1d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 teaspoon paprika","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 teaspoon paprika","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"9c4f695b-8a81-4cbd-b449-bbf492fa4f49"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Pinch of cayenne pepper","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Pinch of cayenne pepper","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"651eb6c9-4115-469a-8281-93a2c56e36e0"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"b06e02b8-689b-4ef4-9849-e08a3c55073c"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"6 hamburger buns, toasted","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"6 hamburger buns, toasted","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"8c38747d-46d2-4def-9ddd-88d5ec6625fe"}],"recipe_instructions":[{"id":"e6672081-7c1f-44f6-b08a-31174757a560","title":"","summary":"","text":"Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
