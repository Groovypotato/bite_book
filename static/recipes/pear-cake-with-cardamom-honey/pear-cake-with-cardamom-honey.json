A drizzle of cardamom honey over the warm cake and a dollop of whipped cream sweeten the deal. The recipe calls for Bosc pears, which have tend to be firmer than other varieties, so the fruit holds its shape well during baking. A mandoline makes fast work of cutting the pears into thin, uniform slices.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"775dc6ea-b9b8-4404-a592-b28c3f5e528a","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"aa9fa931-2b64-4242-af2b-ce4f71c9fd7d","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Fruit","slug":"fruit"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William Sonoma","slug":"william-sonoma"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.williams-sonoma.com/m/recipe/pear-cake-with-cardamom-honey.html","date_added":"2025-08-02","date_updated":"2025-08-02T02:09:26.869374Z","created_at":"2025-08-02T02:09:11.460127Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T02:09:26.872777Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 2/3 cups (8 1/2 oz./265 g) all-purpose flour","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 2/3 cups (8 1/2 oz./265 g) all-purpose flour","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"055031ce-2c7e-4f6a-8732-25105837bdc7"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 1/2 tsp. baking powder","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 1/2 tsp. baking powder","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"38684684-edd3-4ad0-82c3-99532d617fef"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"d89342f8-f558-4667-8d32-ed023e61b29d"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. ground ginger","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. ground ginger","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"21f69f4c-b2bc-4597-a879-94c0ff9b9109"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 tsp. ground cinnamon","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"2 tsp. ground cinnamon","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"ff9df884-353c-4455-b5d5-dc988be310d8"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"1 tsp. ground cardamom","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"1 tsp. ground cardamom","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"6710e1b6-6307-4ece-a28b-e25906d003f8"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"16 Tbs.
