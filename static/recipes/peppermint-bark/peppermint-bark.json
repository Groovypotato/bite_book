You can use a double boiler over just barely simmering water or you can use the microwave. The microwave is a little more convenient for most, so my directions are for a microwave. (If using a double boiler, follow this recipe, but melt the chocolate layers in your double boiler over simmering water.) Place 6 ounces of white chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a liquid measuring cup. Add 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Melt in 20-second increments, stirring vigorously with a silicone spatula or spoon after each increment, until completely melted and smooth. White chocolate and chocolate overheat easily, so it’s important to do this in increments. Once melted, stir in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. Pour melted white chocolate into the prepared baking pan, and, with an offset spatula or spoon, spread into a thin smooth layer. (If using a baking sheet, make it as thin as you’d like… I usually spread it out to about 8×12 inches.) Place the baking pan in the refrigerator for 10–15 minutes or until almost completely set. If it sets completely, the bark layers could separate.","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"df74601e-09b8-4e46-805f-15814f7a9e73","title":"","summary":"","text":"Middle layer","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"866b5860-467f-4ab5-bee5-e83e215eb8a4","title":"","summary":"","text":"Place semi-sweet chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a liquid measuring cup.
