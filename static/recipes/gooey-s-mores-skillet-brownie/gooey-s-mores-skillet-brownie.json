Spread 1/2 the brownie batter over the crackers. Dollop the fluff over the batter and add the remaining Hershey's pieces. Now add the remaining graham crackers. Top with the remaining batter, gently spreading. It's OK if the batter doesn't cover all of the fluff. Bake for 25-28 minutes or until the brownies are just set on top, but very jiggly in the center. Remove from the oven, let cool 3-5 minutes. If you'd like to get your fluff extra toasted, you can switch the oven to broil and broil for thirty seconds or use a blow torch to toast the fluff.
