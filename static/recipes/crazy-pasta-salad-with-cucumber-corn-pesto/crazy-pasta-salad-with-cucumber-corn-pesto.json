Add the pasta with the longest cooking time to the pot and stir. Back out the rest of the pasta shapes according to their cook times, and begin checking for doneness at 2 minutes less than the package instructions direct. For example: if you’re using rigatoni, orecchiette, spaghetti, and ditalini, with 12, 9, 8, and 6 minute cook times, respectively, add the rigatoni first, followed by the orecchiette 3 minutes later and so on. Pasta is surprisingly more forgiving than we think! So if one shape needs another 30 seconds to become al dente but the others seem to be done, don’t fret. (But note! This is a great time to cook your pasta TRULY al dente, as the pasta will soak up a lot of the pesto and plump as it sits.)","ingredient_references":[]},{"id":"1cb67a5e-ce9e-4585-97cf-ec3a24e0d236","title":"","summary":"","text":"Drain the pasta, toss with a drizzle of olive oil, and transfer to the refrigerator.
