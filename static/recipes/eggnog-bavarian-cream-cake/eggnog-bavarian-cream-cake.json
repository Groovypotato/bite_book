To prevent this from happening when making the custard base for this Bavarian cream and similar recipes, you must \"temper\" the eggs, or heat them gently. First, pour hot milk in a thin stream into the yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. After returning this mixture to the saucepan over medium heat, whisk constantly to warm the eggs gradually and thicken the custard. Use an instant-read thermometer to test the temperature; it should not rise above 170°F or the eggs will harden.","recipe_category":[],"tags":[{"id":"775dc6ea-b9b8-4404-a592-b28c3f5e528a","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"159ef61d-8647-4722-8274-7b9baa9da436","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"97c58dff-1e54-4a3f-98a9-c169e60bee44","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"Christmas","slug":"christmas"},{"id":"7ce9ab6d-15d8-460a-ad37-d1e2dd704d37","group_id":"9caafcab-dc93-4b1f-9ea8-3f6dd8dcd45c","name":"William Sonoma","slug":"william-sonoma"}],"tools":[],"rating":null,"org_url":"https://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/eggnog-bavarian-cream-cake.html","date_added":"2025-08-01","date_updated":"2025-08-01T20:14:17.602349Z","created_at":"2025-08-01T20:14:01.592148Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T20:14:17.605345Z","last_made":null,"recipe_ingredient":[{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"Chocolate Ladyfingers","is_food":false,"disable_amount":true,"display":"Chocolate Ladyfingers","title":null,"original_text":null,"reference_id":"f72e852c-5bff-4685-a6f3-47eb54220b07"},{"quantity":1.0,"unit":null,"food":null,"note":"2 1⁄4 tsp.
