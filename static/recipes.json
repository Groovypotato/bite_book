Back out the rest of the pasta shapes according to their cook times, and begin checking for doneness at 2 minutes less than the package instructions direct. For example: if you\u2019re using rigatoni, orecchiette, spaghetti, and ditalini, with 12, 9, 8, and 6 minute cook times, respectively, add the rigatoni first, followed by the orecchiette 3 minutes later and so on. Pasta is surprisingly more forgiving than we think! So if one shape needs another 30 seconds to become al dente but the others seem to be done, don\u2019t fret. (But note! This is a great time to cook your pasta TRULY al dente, as the pasta will soak up a lot of the pesto and plump as it sits.)",

Pulse just a few times, until coarsely chopped, and the pieces range from the size of an almond to the size of a pine nut. IMPORTANT: Pulse conservatively! You may only need to pulse 3-4 times.

At this point, the mixture will likely be thick and look a little grainy. Microwave in 15-second increments on 50% power, stirring in between each until smooth and pourable (I did four rounds of this). Stir in green food coloring, then pour over cooled brownies and spread until smooth. Tap the pan on the counter to help smooth out any bumps.",

Remove the sauce from the stove and let is cool 15-20 minutes, stirring every so often. Make sure the caramel does not become too stiff. If it stiffens too much you will not be able to dip the apples. While the sauce cools, push the twigs or wooden sticks into the top of the apples. Line a baking sheet with wax paper.",
        "When the caramel has cooled (it should be a little thicker now, but still pourable), pour about half the caramel over the cake and allow it to fall down the sides of the cake. Working quickly, dip the apples into the remaining caramel and place the in the center of cake. Sprinkle the cake with flakey salt and peanuts. Make room in the fridge for the cake and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. The caramel should never get completely hard, but should be more of a soft firm. Once the caramel is firm, store the cake in the fridge until ready to serve. Allow the cake to sit 15 minutes at room temp before serving. Please not that this is a delicate and with all the toppings it is a bit tricky to slice. Your slices will not be perfect."

        "Using a nut grinder, a rotary cheese grater with small holes or the small holes of a box grater, finely grind or grate the walnuts. (Don\u2019t use a food processor or the nuts will be too heavy.) Gently scoop into a bowl. Set aside.",
        "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the egg yolks, 3/4 cup (6 oz./185 g) of the granulated sugar and the espresso powder. Beat on high speed until thickened and pale. Drizzle in the remaining butter and beat until combined.",
        "In a clean stand mixer bowl fitted with a clean whisk attachment, combine the egg whites and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed until foamy. Raise the speed to high and beat until peaks begin to form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup (2 oz./60 g) granulated sugar and beat until the whites hold stiff, glossy peaks.",
        "Scoop about one-third of the whites into the bowl with the yolk mixture. Sprinkle one-third of the walnuts over the top and gently fold together. Fold in another one-third of the whites and walnuts, then fold in the rest until no white streaks remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.",
        "Bake until the top is nicely browned and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes. Run a knife around the inside edge of the pan. Remove the ring from the pan and let the cake cool to room temperature.",
        "To make the burnt orange caramel, place the granulated sugar in a heavy saucepan and shake it gently to distribute the sugar. Place over medium heat and cook, swirling the pan occasionally as the sugar begins to melt and turn brown, about 10 minutes; some spots will cook and caramelize sooner than others. When all of the sugar is melted, remove from the heat and carefully pour in the orange juice; the caramel will spatter and clump up. Return the pan to medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the clumps have dissolved and the caramel is deep brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then pour into a bowl and let cool completely.",
        "To serve, carefully invert the cooled cake onto a plate and gently remove the metal bottom. Peel off the parchment. Invert the cake onto a serving platter. Dust with cocoa powder and confectioners\u2019 sugar and serve with the caramel. Makes one 9-inch (23-cm) cake; serves 10 to 12."

      "title": "Our Ultimate Guide to Making Bagels",
      "ingredients": [
        "2\u00bc cups/530 milliliters lukewarm water (105 to 110 degrees)",
        "2 tablespoons barley malt syrup (available in health food stores and some well-stocked supermarkets; an equal volume of molasses is a passable substitute, but won\u2019t impart the traditional malty flavor)",
        "1 (\u00bc-ounce) packet active dry yeast (about 2\u00bc teaspoons)",
        "6\u00bd cups/885 grams bread flour (or use 6 cups bread flour and \u00bd cup whole-wheat flour), plus more for kneading",
        "2 tablespoons/17 grams Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 tablespoon/17 grams Morton kosher salt",
        "Neutral oil, for greasing the baking sheets",
        "1 teaspoon baking soda",
        "\u00bc cup/60 milliliters barley malt syrup, plus more as needed",
        "2 ounces/30 grams each sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, dried minced garlic, dried minced onion and/or flaky salt"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "1. Pour \u00bd cup/120 milliliters lukewarm water into a small bowl. Whisk in 2 tablespoons barley malt syrup and the packet of yeast until both dissolve. Let sit until the mixture foams, about 5 minutes.",
        "2. In a large bowl, combine bread flour and salt (and whole-wheat flour, if using), and make a well in the center. Pour in yeast mixture and the remaining 1\u00be cups/420 milliliters lukewarm water, and mix, using the flexible spatula or wooden spoon, until the dough is shaggy.",
        "3. Knead the mixture in the bowl several times, continuously folding it over and onto itself and pressing down firmly to bring it together in a solid mass, then turn it out onto a clean work surface. Continue kneading until there are no dry spots, then, adding more flour only if needed to prevent stubborn sticking, until you have a stiff but very smooth dough that is still slightly tacky, 15 to 20 minutes. Tip: This amount of kneading, necessary to develop the gluten for a chewy bagel, is best done by hand, since the motor of the average stand mixer would strain against the very stiff dough.",
        "4. Gather the dough into a ball, dust it lightly with flour, and place it in a large, clean bowl, seam-side down. Cover with a damp towel and let the dough rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, 1\u00bd to 2 hours.",
        "5. Using your fist, lightly punch down the dough to knock out some of the air, and turn it out onto a clean work surface. Using a bench scraper, cut the dough into 12 equal pieces, either eyeballing it or using a scale to weigh out 4\u2153-ounce/125-gram pieces. If you prefer a slightly smaller bagel, which is more traditional, you could make a baker\u2019s dozen (13) and weigh out 4-ounce portions. Why? This will help all your bagels rise more evenly in the oven and look better overall.",
        "6. Before you form the bagels, preshape the pieces into tight balls. Working one ball at a time, gather all the irregular edges and pinch them together firmly to make a teardrop shape (above). Place the dough seam-side down on the surface and cup your hand down and over top of the dough in a loose grip (like a claw, or like you\u2019re playing the piano).",
        "Move your hand in a rapid circular motion, dragging the dough across the surface until it has a high, tight dome. Repeat with all the pieces, then cover them with the damp towel and let rest for 5 minutes.",
        "7. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper, brush lightly with oil, and set aside. Working one piece at a time, roll out a ball on the surface beneath your palms into a 9-inch-long rope. Apply extra pressure at the ends of the rope to thin them slightly, then wrap the rope around one hand where your palm and fingers meet, overlapping the ends by an inch or two along the inside of your hand (above). Tip: Don\u2019t add flour to your work surface. The friction with the surface will help stretch the dough.",
        "8. Roll the dough under your hand back and forth several times to seal together the ends, then slip the ring of dough off your hand and stretch it to even out the thickness all the way around until you have a ring that measures about 4 inches across (above). As you form each ring, place it on a parchment-lined sheet, arranging six to a sheet and spacing evenly. Tip: You can also poke a thumb through the ball of dough to make the hole and then widen and stretch with your hands into a ring, but the wrapping and rolling method tends to give more of a classic bagel look.",
        "9. When you\u2019ve formed all the bagels, cover each baking sheet with a piece of plastic, followed by a damp towel to create a sealed, moist environment for the bagels to proof slowly. Transfer the baking sheets to the refrigerator and chill at least 4 hours and up to 24.",
        "10. About 2 hours before you\u2019d like to serve the bagels, arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Fill a large, wide Dutch oven halfway with water and place it on the stove. (Heat should be off at this point.) Set a wire rack next to the Dutch oven. If topping the bagels, spread several tablespoons each of sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, dried minced garlic, dried minced onion and flaky salt on separate large plates in generous, even layers. Set the plates of toppings next to the wire rack. Tip: Mix together all the toppings to make an \u201ceverything\u201d blend.",
        "11. Remove one baking sheet from the refrigerator. Fill a small bowl with room temperature water, then carefully peel one ring of dough off the parchment paper and transfer it to the bowl. It should float, indicating that the bagels are ready to boil and bake. Remove the ring from the water, pat it dry on a towel and place back on the baking sheet. Remove the other baking sheet from the refrigerator. Tip: The dough sank? That\u2019s OK! Let both sheets sit at room temperature, covered, to finish rising, and test if the dough floats every 10 minutes after the first 30 minutes or so.",
        "12. Set the Dutch oven over high heat and bring to a boil. Whisk in the baking soda and \u00bc cup barley malt syrup. You want the water to look like strong black tea, so add more barley malt syrup by the tablespoon until it does. Bring everything back to a boil, reduce the heat if necessary to maintain a gentle boil, and skim any foam from the surface. Uncover one baking sheet and carefully transfer as many bagels as will comfortably fit in one layer to the Dutch oven, leaving some room for them to bob around. Boil for 1 minute, turning halfway through. Tip: If the \u00bc cup barley malt syrup made the liquid very dark, more like black coffee, add a little water to dilute.",
        "13. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the bagels to the wire rack and repeat with the remaining bagels on the first sheet. The bagels will swell in the water, then deflate when removed, but they will puff up again in the oven. Discard the piece of parchment that was underneath the bagels but reserve the baking sheet.",
        "14. Add the optional topping: Working with one at a time, place a boiled bagel on one of the plates with the toppings and turn to coat so the topping adheres to the wet surface of the dough on both sides. Place the coated bagels on the empty baking sheet, flat-side down, and repeat with the remaining boiled bagels, spacing evenly.",
        "15. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake until the bagels are deeply brown, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet 180 degrees after 12 minutes.",
        "16. While the first sheet of bagels is in the oven, repeat the boiling and coating process with the second sheet, adding more toppings to the plates as needed. Transfer the second sheet to the oven when the first is finished. Let the bagels cool completely on a wire rack before slicing with a serrated knife. Tip: Bagels are best eaten the day they\u2019re baked, but they also freeze well. Place the bagels in a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze up to one month."

Since our rub recipes contain no salt (we explain why in the headnote above), we recommend you sprinkle on 1/2 teaspoon of Morton Coarse Kosher Salt per pound (453.6 g) of meat up to 12 hours in advance. For most meats, dampen the surface of the meat with water and sprinkle enough Meathead's Memphis Dust on to coat, but not so much you can't see the meat below. Apply the rub thick enough to make a crunchy crust. Keep your powder dry as the old expression goes. To prevent cross-contamination, one hand sprinkles on the rub and the other hand does the rubbing. Don't put the hand that is rubbing into the powder or use it to hold the bottle.",

        "375g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting",
        "7g fast-action dried yeast",
        "7g salt",
        "30g caster sugar",
        "30g vegetarian shortening, softened and cut into pieces",
        "250ml water"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Make the baps. Tip the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Add the shortening and 250ml of water and turn the mixture around with your fingertips, gradually incorporating the flour until you have a soft, but not soggy dough (you may not need all the water).",
        "Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 8\u201310 minutes, until silky and smooth. Place it in the prepared bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise in a warm place or proving drawer for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.",
        "Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions (it will be quite wet, but this prevents a dry burger) and shape each into a burger. You don\u2019t have to use all the mixture if you want smaller burgers (shape the leftovers into burgers or veggie meatballs to freeze for another time). Place on a prepared baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes to firm up.",
        "Meanwhile, divide the risen dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each piece into a loose ball: to do this, place each piece on the work surface and cover it in a cage formed by your cupped hand. Move your hand in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly to shape it (this will also naturally knock out the air).",
        "Set the rolls aside on a floured surface, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for 10 minutes.",
        "Using a rolling pin, flatten each ball of dough and place it on a prepared baking sheet. Leave enough space between each roll for expansion. Place each baking sheet in a proving bag and leave in a warm place to prove for 45 minutes, until risen to almost double in size.",
        "Heat the oven to 220\u00b0C/200\u00b0C/425\u00b0F/Gas 7. Lightly dust the surface of the rolls with flour, then bake them for 10\u201315 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."

        "Preheat the oven to 300.",
        "In the bowl of a food processor, combine 2 \u00bd cups pecans, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon ground cardamom, \u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon, \u00be teaspoon salt. Process until the pecans are very finely ground and no larger pieces remain.",
        "In a medium saucepan (3-5 quarts), melt 10 tablespoons butter over medium.",
        "Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the melted butter into the pecan mixture, pulsing to incorporate. (Leave the remaining melted butter aside for now.)",
        "Separate one egg white from the yolk, reserving the yolk for later. Add the egg white to the pecans and pulse again until the mixture forms a dough\u2013it will come together when squeezed between your fingers.",
        "Lightly brush a deep dish pie plate all over with some of the reserved melted butter. Dump the pecan mixture into the pie plate and use your hands and the back of a flat bottomed measuring cup to press it evenly into the pie plate and up the sides, letting it creep up and onto to the rim of the pie plate by about \u00bd\u201d. Take your time with this making sure everything is evenly spread out and the crust rises up to the top of the pan. Crimp the edges if desired.",
        "Transfer to the oven and bake until the crust no longer appears wet and is just barely set, but not yet browned, about 15 minutes.",
        "Wipe out the food processor, and return it to its base. Add the reserved egg yolk, 3 whole eggs, \u00bd cup canned pumpkin, \u00be cup sugar, \u00be cup honey, \u00bd cup heavy cream, the remaining melted butter, 1 tablespoon cornmeal, \u00bd teaspoon cardamom, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, \u00bd teaspoon ground nutmeg (freshly ground or pre ground both work), 1 teaspoon salt. Pulse in a few long pulses until smooth.",
        "Finely grate enough ginger to measure 2 teaspoons packed. Add it to the filling and pulse once more.",
        "Pour the pumpkin filling into the medium saucepan that you used to melt the butter, scraping with a spatula so you don\u2019t lose any! Set the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking the custard constantly until very hot but not yet boiling\u2013you\u2019ll turn the heat off just before you start to see the edges start to simmer, 3-5 minutes.",
        "Pour into the pie crust.",
        "Return the filled pie to the oven and bake until the custard is just set, and the center is barely jiggly, about 30-35 minutes. It should be set like jiggly jello, and may have a thin layer of pale foam that has risen to the top, depending on what type of honey you use. Some honeys will crystalize while in the oven and others will not. If your pie has a layer of foam, no worries, it\u2019s easy to remove to reveal a glassy pie beneath: While the pie is still warm, take a piece of plastic wrap that is larger than the circumference of the pie and lay it on top of the pie, very very gently pressing to encourage the plastic to adhere to the top of the pie. Holding the plastic with two hands, peel it off of the pie. The foamy layer should come off with it. If you miss a few spots, you can always repeat this process again. Alternatively, you can brush the layer away with a pastry brush, it comes off very easily.",
        "Let the pie cool fully and then either eat at room temperature day of, or refrigerate until ready to serve. Just before serving, sprinkle the pie generously with flaky sea salt.",
        "Whip the remaining cups heavy cream to soft peaks (however is easiest for you)--it\u2019s unsweetened intentionally\u2013this pie is already very sweet! Serve pie with whipped cream."

Stir with a spatula until the mixture is smooth; set aside to cool and thicken to a scoopable consistency while you make the cookies. If it is warm in your kitchen, cover the filling and transfer it to the refrigerator to firm up.",
        "To make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line them with parchment.",

        "Use a spoon or a teaspoon cookie scoop to portion 1\" balls of dough and place onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2\" between them on all sides; they'll spread as they bake.",
        "Bake the cookies for 11 to 13 minutes, until they're puffed and their edges are set.",
        "Remove the cookies from the oven and allow to cool completely on the pans.",
        "To assemble the cookies: Once the cookies have completely cooled and the filling is firm, place a heaping teaspoon of filling (again, a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here) onto the bottom side of one cookie, and top with another cookie, flat-side down. Roll the edges of the sandwich cookie in sugar or sprinkles, if desired.",
        "Storage information: Store any leftover sandwiched Biscoff cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage."

        "Once all of the dumplings are shaped, gently add them to the pot of boiling water, bring it back to simmer, cover the pot with a lid and set a timer for 30 minutes. Check for doneness by scooping out one dumpling and cutting into it. The dumpling should be light and fluffy throughout with no darker dense spots. If it\u2019s not quite there, continue cooking them for 5 minutes longer.",
        "As the dumplings cook, work on the sauce. Coarsely crush or chop 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds until coarsely ground.",
        "Thinly slice 5 garlic cloves. Cut 4 tablespoons butter into pads (so it's\u2019 no longer in one stick).",
        "In the large skillet over medium heat, melt 2 more tablespoons of butter along with the caraway seeds, sliced garlic, and a few big cracks of black pepper until the caraway seeds and garlic are fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Before it starts to brown, add a big ladle (about \u00bd cup) of the dumpling cooking water to the skillet to stop the cooking. Bring the sauce to a simmer, once it simmers, start adding the 4 cold tablespoons of butter, one at a time, stirring and shaking the pan between additions, and ensuring one pad of butter is fully melted into the sauce before adding the next. By the end the sauce should be thick and bubbling and emulsified. Season with salt until it tastes really good, then remove from heat until the dumplings are done.",
        "Once the dumplings are cooked, use a slotted spoon or spider to add them to the skillet of rye butter (it\u2019s ok if some of the water comes over with them, that will help to create the pan sauce.) Set the skillet over high heat and cook, shaking the pan vigorously and turning the dumplings gently with a spoon to coat them in the caraway butter, until the butter sauce is thick and emulsified. You may need to add more water if the butter sauce looks splitty or oily. The agitation of the pan will thicken the sauce. Once coated and glossy, remove from heat.",
        "Cut one lemon into wedges for serving.",
        "Divide the dumplings amongs plates or shallow serving bowls. Top each one with a few more sprigs of dill and some flaky sea salt and a lemon wedge alongside."

You can also heat this on the stove; remove it once it begins to steam.",
        "Use a hot pad to carefully remove milk from the microwave and pour over the chocolate chips (do not stir yet!). Use a fork to press down the chips so that they're fully covered with the cream.Allow to sit for about 3 minutes, then use a fork to stir; it will be thick and will likely look like it's not going to mix together but keep at it until smooth & creamy.If your mixture doesn't melt down, microwave in 10 second increments at 50% power, stirring in between each increment until smooth.",
        "Spoon 1 tablespoon of chocolate ganache on each cookie and top with rainbow chip sprinkles. Place in refrigerator for 30-60 minutes to help the ganache harden.",

Spread brownie batter into the prepared pan until smooth.Note: baking these in glass or dark metal pans may cause them to overbake and become bitter.

Allow to cool for about 30 minutes before pouring over cooled brownies.",

      "ingredients": [
        "2 scallions",
        "405g (3 cups plus 3 tablespoons) bread flour, divided",
        "50g (1/4 cup) sugar, plus 1 teaspoon",
        "1 \u00bd teaspoon active dry yeast",
        "2 teaspoons kosher salt",
        "Maldon sea salt, for sprinkling",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "1 cup whole milk, divided",
        "5 tablespoons of room temperature butter, plus more for greasing",
        "2 large eggs"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "In a small saucepan, whisk 24g (3 tablespoons) bread flour with \u00bd cup milk until smooth. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until a thickened paste forms, about 2 to 3 minutes (It will look a bit like mashed potatoes). Remove from heat and let cool in a bowl.",
        "While tangzhong is cooling, warm remaining \u00bd cup of milk in a saucepan until just warm to the touch (but not hot). Add a pinch of sugar and 1\u00bd teaspoons yeast and whisk to dissolve. Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes until bloomed and a foamy layer appears.",
        "Cut 2 tablespoons of room-temperature butter into small pieces.",
        "In small bowl, lightly beat one egg until homogenous.",
        "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine 350g (2\u00be cup) bread flour, \u00bc cup sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 beaten egg. Add the now cool tangzhong and yeast mixture and mix on low until dough is shaggy and is just starting to come together.",
        "Add the 2 tablespoons of butter, piece by piece, making sure each piece is fully incorporated before adding the next.",
        "Increase speed to medium and mix, scraping down the side of the bowl when necessary, until smooth, supple, and slightly sticky, about 8 to 10 minutes.",
        "Transfer to a work surface and pinch down ends to form a smooth ball. Place inside a large pre-greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let proof in a warm place until doubled in size, 90 min to 2 hours.",
        "Finely chop 2 scallions, discarding the hairy ends.",
        "In a small heat-proof bowl, place 1 heaping tablespoon of chopped scallions (reserving the rest) with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and a few turns of ground black pepper.",
        "In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook 3 tablespoons butter, swirling with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, until butter starts to foam. Let butter toast, until it begins to brown and smell fragrant and nutty, 3-4 minutes.",
        "Pour onto prepared bowl of scallions.",
        "Add 31g (\u00bc cup) bread flour and mix until a thin paste forms. Set aside to cool. At this point, you can taste this filling and adjust with salt or pepper \u2013 this is what will add that scallion flavor to your bread.",
        "Grease a 13x9\u201d pan with butter.",
        "Once dough has doubled in size, transfer proofed dough onto a floured workspace and punch it down.",
        "Roll dough into a 13x9\u201d rectangle.",
        "With a spatula, spread half of the scallion-butter paste into thin layer onto one half of the dough. Sprinkle with half the remaining scallions.",
        "Fold the side without the filling over the side with the filling. Roll again into a rectangle. Repeat one more time, spreading with remaining filling and scallions. Fold in half again and the roll to form a rectangle approximately 13x9\u201d in size.",
        "With a bench scraper or knife, cut dough into 12 pieces (4 rows of 3).",
        "Working with one piece at a time, gather the edges and pull down and pinch together, stretching the top so that it is smooth, and a ball is formed. On an unfloured part of your work surface, roll the balls in a circular motion to tighten them up and create nicely formed balls.",
        "Place 12 formed rolls evenly spaced out in your prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until rolls have doubled in size, about 30 to 60 minutes, depending how warm your kitchen is.",
        "Preheat oven to 350.",
        "Lightly beat 1 egg with a splash of water to create an egg wash.",
        "When rolls are ready, brush with egg wash, then sprinkle with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Bake until the tops are golden brown, approximately 20 to 22 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in pan for another 5 minutes. Then remove and set on a wire rack to cool completely."

Increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin, more lemon juice if frosting is too thick, or add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.

Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with about 1 cup of frosting. Top with the third cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides.

Let steep in the oil for 15 minutes.",

It should be drizzelable but homogeneous with lots of little bits of crunchy chilies and nuts. Transfer to a bowl and season with the juice of 2 limes and 1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt; add more of either to taste.",
        "Remove the stems from 1 \u00bc pounds mushrooms. If your mushrooms are especially dirty, give them a quick rinse. Otherwise, brush off any small pieces of dirt with a paper towel. Cut into 1/2\u201d slices and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 1/4 cup of olive oil and \u00be teaspoon each smoked paprika, dried oregano, and pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss together to coat the mushrooms with seasonings and oil.",
        "Place on the bottom rack in the oven and cook for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through, until browned and crispy in spots, but still plump--they shouldn't be mushroom chips! While the mushrooms are cooking, make the garlic crema and start on the tortillas.",
        "Finely chop 2 tablespoons of cilantro and place in a small bowl. Grate 1 clove of garlic into the same bowl, then add in \u00bd cup crema or sour cream, the juice of 1 lime and \u00bd teaspoon of salt. If you like, add 1-2 tablespoons of water to thin down the consistency to something that can drizzle. Adjust salt and lime juice to taste.",
        "Spread \u00bc cup shredded cheese in an even layer in a circle in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Leave to melt, undisturbed. Once melted and starting to brown on the edges, place 1 corn tortilla on top, slightly offset from the circle of cheese to leave a little bit of the melting cheese visible. Continue to cook until the cheese is browned and toasty, another 30-45 seconds. Use a spatula to loosen the cheese from the pan and flip the tortilla. Cook for another 20 seconds, then move to a plate. Keep tortillas warm under a tea towel or in a tortilla warmer while you repeat with remaining tortillas and cheese.",
        "Slice the avocados. Cut remaining 2 limes into wedges. Tear a handful of cilantro.",
        "Schmear garlic crema over the center of each cheesy corn tortilla. Top with about \u00bc cup shiitake mushrooms, a spoonful of salsa macha, a few slices of avocado and some torn cilantro. Serve lime wedges on the side for squeezing."

Don\u2019t worry if some slices are slightly thicker than the rest-- a little variation is totally fine. Alternatively, use a mandoline. If your onions are wider than your mandoline, cut them in half through the root end. Set the mandoline to a thickness of about -inch.",

Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll get your hands involved. Coating the rings super well is key to crispiness! (Note that the longer the rings stay in the marinade, the more they'll break down/collapse. You may need to take a bit more time when dredging them to ensure that every ring is individually coated in flour, but the payoff to a longer marinade is more flavor)",
        "Shake off any excess flour from the rings. Using a spider or a pair of tongs, gently lower about one-third to one-half of the onions into the oil, being sure not to overcrowd the pot. Gently stir to prevent clumping and immediately increase heat to high to maintain an oil temperature of 350 degrees (and lowering it as needed). Fry until onion rings are crisp and golden brown, about 3 \u00bd to 5 \u00bd minutes.",

        "Meanwhile, make the cardamom honey: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the honey and cardamom and heat, stirring, until the honey is very runny, about 3 minutes. Taste and add more cardamom, if desired. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.",
        "To make the whipped cream, in the clean bowl of the electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the cream, vanilla and sugar on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes; do not overbeat.",

Using a second wire rack, turn the cake right side up, with the pears on the top. While the cake is still warm, place the rack with the cake on top of a baking sheet and pour the cardamom honey evenly over the cake. Transfer the cake to a platter, cut into slices and serve warm, spooning some of the whipped cream on top of each slice. Serves 8."

Join the opposite corners together and press to form a triangle.

Dab a little water on one \u201carm\\\" and join with the opposite corner, like \u201carms\u201d crossing under the \u201cbelly\u201d of the dumpling so it looks like a little bowl (ideal for catching sauce). Set on the baking sheet and repeat until you run out of wrappers or filling (fry up any leftover filling for a little snackington).",
        "If you\u2019re not cooking the dumplings right away, keep them covered in the refrigerator for up to a couple hours. Otherwise, freeze them on a baking sheet, taking care that they\u2019re not touching, until frozen solid, then store in an air-tight container for up to 2 months.",
        "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook dumplings in batches of 10 or so, about 2-3 minutes (add another minute if cooking frozen dumplings). They\u2019ll float when they\u2019re done. Use a slotted spoon to remove the dumplings from the water, let excess water drain a few seconds and place in a serving bowl. Repeat with remaining dumplings. Serve with crispy chili sauce."

The microwave is a little more convenient for most, so my directions are for a microwave. (If using a double boiler, follow this recipe, but melt the chocolate layers in your double boiler over simmering water.) Place 6 ounces of white chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a liquid measuring cup. Add 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Melt in 20-second increments, stirring vigorously with a silicone spatula or spoon after each increment, until completely melted and smooth. White chocolate and chocolate overheat easily, so it\u2019s important to do this in increments. Once melted, stir in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. Pour melted white chocolate into the prepared baking pan, and, with an offset spatula or spoon, spread into a thin smooth layer. (If using a baking sheet, make it as thin as you\u2019d like\u2026 I usually spread it out to about 8\u00d712 inches.) Place the baking pan in the refrigerator for 10\u201315 minutes or until almost completely set. If it sets completely, the bark layers could separate.",
        "Middle layer",

Once melted, stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. Pour all of the semi-sweet chocolate over the white chocolate layer and spread it into a smooth layer. Place the baking pan back in the refrigerator for 10\u201315 minutes or until almost completely set.",
        "Top layer",
        "Place the remaining white chocolate in a small heatproof bowl or a liquid measuring cup. Add last 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Repeat melting, just as you did with the other layers. Pour over the bark layers and spread into a smooth layer. (This layer will not have peppermint extract.) Sprinkle evenly with crushed candy canes. To crush, place the unwrapped candy canes in a sealed zipped-top bag and roll or bang with a rolling pin or meat mallet until crushed.",
        "Refrigerate the bark until completely set, about 1 hour. Once hardened, remove from the pan and peel off the foil or parchment. Break or cut into pieces as large or as small as you want. If your bark chilled in the refrigerator for longer than 3\u20134 hours, let it sit at room temperature for 10\u201315 minutes to slightly soften before breaking/slicing. (Or else the layers might separate.)",

        "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss well to combine. Taste and add more red wine vinegar as needed until it\u2019s super bright, and zingy--its should be more intense than a salad, since it\u2019s going to be combined with bread.",
        "This is not a necessary step, but if your hoagie roll feels particularly soft and spongy, doing so will help avoid sog-town. If your roll is quite sturdy, you can move on to assembly.",
        "Preheat your broiler or toaster oven. Split 2 hoagie rolls in half lengthwise and toast them until golden brown on cut sides.",
        "Swipe each side of the hoagie roll with a light coating of calabrian chilies (especially if your giardiniera is mild.) This is totally optional but lends more spice and a funky note to the sando.",

        "Pile the shrettuce slaw on top of each one--you\u2019ll need more than you think. The sandwich will compress once the top of the hoagie roll is on top. You\u2019re ultimately aiming for a sandwich that is 50 percent meat and 50 percent slaw once it\u2019s sliced.",
        "Top each sandwich with the top of the roll and cut in half crosswise. If it looks particularly unwieldy, you can wrap the hoag in parchment or foil to help keep it together."

Immediately add the chicken, skin side down and cook over medium heat, undisturbed, and moving the chicken only if it looks like the skin is burning in some areas, until deeply golden brown and crisp, 12-15 minutes. If some are crisping more quickly than others, rotate the skillet to allow areas that aren't getting as much love to hit the hotter spots of the burner. Transfer the chicken to a large plate, skin side up. Turn off the heat.",
        "Tip out or spoon out and discard any accumulated fat in the pan. Return the pan to the medium low heat and add 3 tablespoons of butter. The pan will still be really hot and the butter should melt quickly. Once melted, add the peppercorns, shallots and garlic and a big pinch of salt. Cook over medium low, stirring occasionally so the aromatics don\u2019t burn, until really soft and cooked down, about 5-7 minutes. If it looks like the garlic is burning, turn the heat down; this process should take some time.",
        "Once jammy, stir in 3 tablespoons miso paste and 3 tablespoons sherry. Cook, increasing the heat a tad if needed to bring the sauce to a bare simmer, stirring to incorporate the miso into the wine sauce until it has all been incorporated and the sherry has mostly cooked off, about 1-2 minutes.",
        "Remove from the heat, and stir in \u00bd cup tap water (room temp is good). Nestle the chicken legs back into the skillet, skin side up and transfer to oven to finish cooking. Set a timer for 8 minutes. If after 8 minutes the skillet looks dry, add another few splashes of water \u2013 you want the chicken to be sitting in a thin layer of sauce. Return to the oven and cook until the sauce is thick and burbling and most of the liquid has evaporated but the skillet is not dry and the aromatics are not stuck to the bottom, 8-11 minutes longer (if cooking whole legs, you\u2019ll want to leave them in for 11 minutes, if making thighs, 8 or 9 minutes will suffice).",
        "Remove the skillet from the oven and place on the stovetop. Transfer the chicken to the large plate again to make some room in the skillet. While still hot, stir in \u00bd cup creme fraiche and all of the sliced chives, until very well combined. You are not working over any heat here, the heat of the skillet will be enough to warm the creme fraiche and loosen the sauce. Taste and add more salt if needed. Return the chicken legs to the sauce and serve right out of the skillet or transfer to a serving platter. if you want to maintain that crispy shattery skin, don\u2019t spoon the sauce on top or it will reverse all the work you did to get there!"
